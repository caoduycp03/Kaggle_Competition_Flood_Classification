1557083262,19_Verona.jpg,"The Adige (Italian: Adige; Venetian: Àdexe; Trentin: Ades; Friulian: Adis; German: Etsch; Ladin: Adesc, or Adiç; Latin: Athesis). It's a river with its source in the Alpine region of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol near the Italian border with Austria and Switzerland. At 410 km in length, 220 located in the province of Bolzano, it is the second longest river in Italy, after the Po River with 652 km. The river flows out of the artificial Alpine Lake Resia, located at the Resia Pass (1504 m) close to the borders with Austria and Switzerland above the Inn valley. The lake is known for the church tower that marks the site of the former village of Curon Antica (Alt Graun) that was abandoned and flooded in 1953 when the dam was finished. Near Glurns, the Rom River from the Swiss Val Müstair joins. The Adige then runs eastbound through the Vinschgau (Venosta Valley) to Merano where it is met by the Passirio river from the north. South of Bolzano, the Isarco joins the river that is now heading south through a valley that always has been one of the major routes through the Alps, leading to and from the Resia Pass and the Brenner Pass, at 1370 m considered the easiest of the main Alpine passes. The Salurner Klause/Chiusa di Salorno narrows at Salorno marks the southern-most part of the German-speaking area. Thus, the Adige was mentioned in the Lied der Deutschen of 1841 as the southern border of the German language area of the time. This song was made the national anthem of Germany in 1922, after Italy took control of all of the Adige. Near Trento, the Avisio, Noce, and Fersina rivers join. The Adige then crosses Trentino and later Veneto, flowing past the city of Verona and the towns of Rovereto and Adria through the Lagarina valley and the north-eastern part of the Po plain into the Adriatic sea. Both the Adige and the Po run parallel in the river delta without properly joining. As a river in the mountains, it is subject to sudden swellings and overflows. It is also connected through artificial underground canals to Lake Garda for flood prevention.","adige, city, fiume, italy, river, veneto, verona"

The large, square Magdalen Tower is a famous Oxford landmark, and it is a tradition since the days of Henry VII that the college choir sings from the top of it at 6 a.m. on May Morning. The Grove or Deer Park is a large meadow occupies most of the north west of the college's grounds, from the New Buildings and the Grove Quad up to Holywell Ford. During the winter and spring, it is the home of a herd of deer. It is possible to view the meadow (and also the deer) from the path between New Buildings and Grove Quad, and also from the archway in New Buildings. In the 16th century, long before the introduction of the deer, the grove consisted of gardens, orchards, and bowling greens. During the Civil War, it was used to house a regiment of soldiers. At one point in the 19th century it was home to three traction engines belonging to the works department of the college. By the 20th century it had become well-wooded with many large trees, but most of them were lost to Dutch Elm Disease in the 1970s. The Meadow lies to the east of the college, bounded on all sides by the River Cherwell. In the spring, it is filled with the flower Fritillaria meleagris (commonly known as Snakeshead Fritillary), which gives it an attractive green-purple colour. These flowers grow in very few places, and have been recorded growing in the meadow since around 1785. Once the flowering has finished, the deer are moved in for the Summer and Autumn. In wet winters, some or all of the meadow may flood, as the meadow is lower lying than the surrounding path. All around the edge of the meadow is a tree-lined path, Addison's Walk. It is a beautiful and tranquil walk, favoured by students, dons, and visitors alike. The Fellows' Garden is located to the north east of the Meadow, directly behind the new building of the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies. This long and (fairly) narrow garden follows the Cherwell to the edge of the University Parks . In spring, the ground is covered with flowers. In summer, there are some flowers, many different shrubs, and the varied trees provide dappled cover from the sun. It is linked to Addison's Walk by a bridge."" en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalen_College,_Oxford www.magdalen.edu/ ...","addison's walk, cherwell, england, great britain, magdalen, magdalen college, oxford, river cherwell, united kingdom"

5071105855,GOLA ABBEY - Manor house built from old priory,"TALK ABOUT A NIGHTMARE – I misguidedly decided that the best way of finding this abbey would be with a GPS. It left me about ten miles from the site but was adamant that I was in Gola. None of the locals had heard of the place. I drove along every side road of beautiful rural Fermanagh for over an hour hoping to see something akin to an old church but found almost nothing and certainly nothing that could be described as the ruin of an abbey. The kindly owner of the Garage at the entrance to Tamlacht gave good directions and a local farmer was very hospitable and helpful with the rest of the search. He owns the field where the church was situated and couldn’t plough it because, he thinks, there are so many large stones buried in the field that it would destroy any ploughshare. The Abbey itself has passed from Ms. Wilson, mentioned in Ambrose Coleman’s account below, and is now the property of a Mr. G. Johnson. The house was built in the 18th century with extensions in the 20th and little remains to indicate that it was an older building. Apparently there is a fine fireplace contained in the almost dilapidated building. Some of the plasterwork on the outer walls has come away and you can see the stones of the original building underneath. Mrs Johnson gave me a most cordial reception considering I had arrived unannounced; “hi, I’m a Dominican and we used to own your house...” Here follows what history I can muster on the forgotten Dominican foundation of Gola! FRIARY OF GOLA Ambrose Coleman, in his appendix to O’Heyne’s Irish Dominicans, writes: THE account of the foundation of this convent, as given by O'Heyne, may be accepted as perfectly correct. The site, which is seven miles south-east of Enniskillen, near Lough Erne, was obtained shortly before the War of the Confederation, but the erection of the house was not commenced till after 1660. About this time a great controversy arose between the Dominicans and the Franciscans, as to the right of the former to quest for alms in the dioceses of Armagh, Down, Dromore and Clogher. For some years the Dominicans had not been seen in Ulster, but on the Restoration of Charles II., the provincial sent Fr. John O' Conor, of Sligo, with some other friars, to establish themselves in the places where they formerly had possessed convents. The Ven. Oliver Plunket, the primate, was commissioned by the Holy See to decide the controversy, and his decision in every case was favourable to the claims of the Dominicans. There was not much difficulty in deciding the claims of the Dominicans to the abbeys of Carlingford and Newtownards, but as regards Gola, the primate says, in a letter dated July 29, 1676 : "" But the existence of their convent in Gaula is only attested by an old parchment book, written many years ago, which contains the annals of that diocese ; and some old persons attest that before the war of Cromwell, there were Dominicans in that diocese who went about to quest, in consequence of this convent ; the Franciscans, however, always opposed them."" In another letter, dated Sept. 8th, the following year, he says : ""I went to the diocese of Clogher, and near Enniskillen, in the convent of the Franciscan Friars, called the contending parties ; the Dominicans adduced the authority of the ancient annals of that town, written in the Irish language, which give the name of the convent of Gaula, the year in which it was founded, the Pope in whose pontificate it was founded for the Dominicans. They also brought forward the testimony of an old priest, who swore that he heard from his father that the convent of Gaula belonged to the Dominicans; they also produced other witnesses who gave like evidence."" The decision of the primate regarding Gola would incline one to believe that it was an ancient foundation like Carlingford and Newtownards, and he seems himself to have been of this opinion. But the negative arguments are irresistible. There is not the slightest reference to the convent of Gola at the time of the Suppression or not even in the inquisition held at Enniskillen, in 1609. There is no Bull of foundation extant such as we find for convents erected in the fifteenth century. The name is not to be found in the list of convents, drawn up by Ross Mageoghegan in 1627, nor in another list made in the sixteenth or seventeenth century, preserved in Trinity College Library. The reference to the ancient manuscript would carry great weight, if it were more defined, but Dr. Fitzsimons, vicar-general of Kilmore, who was one of the commissioners helping the primate, speaks of it as annales patriae pervetustos, quos ipsemet vidi in antiqua membrana exscriptos et apud antiquarium dicti comitatus Fermaniae custoditos. This can be no other than the Annals of Ulster, and it is sufficient to say that there is not the slightest reference in them to a Dominican convent in Gola. The reader .may judge the evidence for himself. In the very year in which the controversy was decided, the primate reports that in Gola convent there are ""eight friars, two of whom are good preachers, Father Thomas Mac Mahon and Father Charles Mac Manus. Here again they have a noviciate."" In the middle of the eighteenth century, there were three fathers in community, of whom one was parish priest. The Dominicans left Gola before 1800, and the convent became a private residence. When the grandfather of the present (1907) occupier, Miss Wilson, came to reside there, the walls only were standing. There is still a very fine old mantelpiece in the kitchen, but the most cursory inspection of the building shows it cannot be placed in the category of the ancient abbeys of the Order in Ireland. FROM BURKE’S HIBERNIA DOMINICANA (1772) “Golan” in MS – “Gola,” the “river forks.” “Gaulae adhuc videre est aliqua antique Caenobii Rudera, Modernus Fundi Dominus est Jacobus King, Armiger.” In 1837, Lewis’ Topological Dictionary of Ireland mentions the abbey : Adjoining Lough Erne, a monastery for Dominican Friars was founded and dedicated to (the Nativity) of the Blessed Virgin, by MacManus, lord of the place, of which there are still some remains, also traces of the village of Gola in which it was situated. Any remains of the ancient monastery are most probably to be found in the farm-house belonging to the daughters of the late Mr. Robert Wilson, who died in 1890. Wilson was the purchaser from the landlord, Sir Charles S. King, of his farms, under Lord Ashbourne’s Act), this was an act that allowed tenants to purchase lands and was to prohibit forced sales and purchases from both parties. The purchasing tenant could avail of government loans to affect the purchase. The date of this Abbey’s foundation is not recorded. Aldfred, King of the Northumbrian Saxons, is stated to have learned here to speak and write in the Gaelic tongue; and his poem in praise of Erin is still extant. Gola Abbey is not returned in the great survey of Fermanagh, made at Devenish, 7 July, 1603; nor in the Inquisition at Enniskillen, 18 September, 1609, to enquire into ecclesiastical lands, the only mention of the place is that it was then part of the herinagh lands of Derrybrusk. I cannot ascertain exactly what a heinagh is but I understand it to be a seventeenth century townland in the Church of Ireland. Heinaghs were listed on maps and required the bishop’s consent to erect indicating that they might well be old ecclesiastical divisons. On the 1609 map of the “Barony of Magherysteffanah,” it appears as an ecclesiastical edifice on the townland “eclamre,” next “tategould” (Gola), and “farranouollan” (Farnamullan). In the Down Survey Map, 1665, the townland is recorded as “Givola.” Dr. Burke describes the convents as suppressed in 1649, and restored at the Restoration. Subsequently to the latter event, Fathers Cathal MacManus and Thomas MacMahon erected a new house at Gola, near the ancient abbey, under the patronage of MacManus, probably a descendant of the original founder. This accounts for the existence of a monastery here so late as the eighteenth century, while the old abbey was the residence of the King family. According to Archdall in his Monasticum Hibernia; in 1756 John Maguire, O.P., aged 55, was prior and Thomas Nolan, O.P., and Anthony Maguire, O.P., were the priests of the community. The King family were certainly in possession of Gola Abbey as far back as the late seventeenth century. John King of Gola, Esq., took part in the defence of Enniskillen in 1689, and his name also appears in the list of signatories to the address to King William and Queen Mary written in that town in 1690. He died somewhere between 1720 and 1726 and his son James took possession of the estate. This is the James King who appointed Sherriff of Fermanagh in 1728 and presented the communion plate to Derryvolane Church. He died in 1756 and Gola passed to his eldest son also called James. This James married Elizabeth Coote of Limerick a cousin of his but died childless in London in 1823. His sister Hannah Honora married Edward Sneyd, Esq., M.P., Carrick, 1777-1781, Their son Nathanial Sneyd, married twice but died without children in 1833, having been shot in Westmoreland Street, Dublin, by, Mr. John Mason, a lunatic. In 1815 Gola was purchased by Abraham Bradley King, another cousin. It passed after his death to his son Charles Simeon King. Although Chales listed Gola as his address he moved into the rebuilt house at Corrad nearby. His new lands included a small island called Inishbeg. One of the promontories of this island was called Friar’s Point and part of the island was referred to as the Friar’s Field. Charles was somewhat a historian and edited the Rev. William Henry’s manuscript, “Upper Lough Erne in 1739” from his home at Corrad. The local rector, Rev. J. W. Kaye, LL.D., penned the following verses which make reference to the friars fishing in the lake at that point: CARRY BRIDGE One summer eve I wander’d on By lough, and mead, and ferry, Until I came and stoodalone Upon the bridge of Carry. Of waters rolling under: My thoughts ran fast upon the past, And fill’d my mind with wonder. I thought of deeds in years gone by, When brothers fought with brothers; When kings waged war with chieftain lords- O’Neills, Maguires, and others; And if they fought near here, I thought, ‘Midst all their flight and flurry, Where would they go? – for then you know There was no bridge at Carry. I thought of good St. Patrick too, Who oft, in Innismore, Would preach to crowds assembled round From hill, and dale, and shore; And there’s the stone, ‘worn to the bone,’ Where oft all night he’d tarry In earnest prayer, in Arda there, Whene’er he pass’d through Carry. I look’d across to Gola then, Where once the Abbey stood; I thought of monks who counted beads In prayerful, solemn mood; I could not name how oft they came With net and “cot” or wherry, As Fridays pass’d and Lenten fast, To catch their fish at Carry. But twilight falls, and seems to hide The visions of the past; The ancient feudal times are gone- ‘Tis well they could not last; And chief’s ne’er wield the sword and shield, Nor desperate spear-thrusts parry; ‘Tis well ‘tis so. Flow, waters, flow Beneath the bridge of Carry Somewhere in the nineteenth century Charles sold Gola Abbey to Robert Wilson who died in possession in 1890 and his daughters remained on after that. Ambrose Coleman, O.P., wrote that the priory had only become a residence at the time that Robert Wilson purchased it. The evidence from the King family indicates that they lived in the priory as far back as 1689 and had remained in residence until Charles King moved to Corrad. The Kings were resident in Gola Abbey at the time of the siege of Enniskillen and were still there in the time that Thomas Burke was writing in 1772; the restoration happened in 1660. It is possible that the house was abandoned for some years as the Kings had renovated Corrad as early as 1825. Archdall’s account indicates that there were three friars living here in 1756 but the records indicate clearly that the Kings were firmly in possession of the old priory at that stage. Maybe the friars lived elsewhere after the restoration? There is a very fine house at the fork on the road that could be the site of the friars’ new home – I’ll have to go back and have another look.

Jesús Jasso Abundis Calle Madero No 7 Col. Centro C.P. 6000 Del. Cuauhtémoc Tel. 5521-7331 Tel. 5518-4690 En el número 7 de avenida Madero, a unos cuantos pasos del Eje Central, se encuentra uno de los edificios históricos más representativos de la evangelización continental: el Templo de San Francisco el Grande, memoria de lo que fuera un majestuoso convento, obra de los primeros frailes franciscanos que llegaron a la Nueva España y de donde partieron en misión hacia el sur y norte de América. El templo de San Francisco fue construido en un terreno anteriormente en ese lugar se encontraba el zoológico del emperador Moctezuma cedido a esta orden religiosa por el conquistador Hernán Cortés. La construcción inició en 1525 casi a la par de una capilla denominada San José de los Naturales, donde fray Pedro de Gante -uno de los tres predicadores que llegó a la Nueva España en 1523, un año antes de que arribaran los primeros 12 franciscanos- levantó el Colegio de Artes y Oficios para los indígenas. Al paso de los años, en torno a la iglesia de San Francisco la Orden de los Frailes Menores -nombre oficial de los religiosos franciscanos- construyó seis capillas más. La última de ellas, dedicada a la Virgen de Valvanera que terminó de construirse a mediados del siglo XVIII y que actualmente es la única que subsiste. El auge La iglesia de San Francisco y las capillas contiguas, aunado a las huertas, los jardines, el panteón, los claustros y muchos otros edificios, formaban parte de lo que se conocía como el Convento de San Francisco de México, explica fray Roberto Rosas, actual responsable del templo. Y agrega: Desgraciadamente, a lo largo de los siglos el convento sufrió incontables derrumbamientos, reconstrucciones y expropiaciones, de tal forma que hoy en día sólo queda la iglesia y la Capilla de Valvanera. El actual templo de San Francisco también ha sufrido cambios. En realidad se trata de la tercera edificación. La primera apunta el religioso franciscano- se derrumbó antes de cumplir 50 años y se levantó una nueva. Más tarde, a finales del siglo XVII y principios del siglo XVIII, debido a las inundaciones y temblores, el templo prácticamente quedó inservible y tuvo que ser derrumbado para construir el actual. Este fue dedicado a principios del siglo XVIII. La caída Para 1860, durante las Leyes de Reforma, comenzó la construcción de calles y avenidas, lo que derivó en la devastación de algunas partes del convento, entre ellas el panteón, de donde fueron extraídos los restos de los primeros 12 franciscanos que llegaron a la Nueva España. Sacaron los cuerpos y jamás se supo dónde los arrojaron seguramente los tiraron, lamenta el fraile. Tras la expropiación del convento, ocurrida en 1864, éste fue fraccionado: el terreno se dividió en lotes que fueron vendidos a particulares y las capillas fueron demolidas prácticamente en su totalidad. La iglesia y la Capilla de Valvanera, conocida actualmente como Capilla de Guadalupe, sobrevivieron gracias a que fueron adquiridas por un grupo de norteamericanos que intentaron formar su propia religión, pero ante el fracaso de la misma, ambas construcciones fueron vendidas a un comité de damas católicas que posteriormente las cedieron a Iglesia. El templo y la capilla fueron custodiadas por los Jesuitas durante algún tiempo hasta que en 1949 regresaron a manos de los franciscanos. A partir de entonces, fray Albino Mesa Castro inició el embellecimiento del recinto que había sido recuperado prácticamente en ruinas luego de haber servido de caballerizas, circo y otras cosas. Las ruinas Fray Roberto Rosas hace un recuento de las edificios desaparecidos y de cómo se han transformado esos espacios, pues donde antiguamente se encontraban las capillas, así como otras edificaciones pertenecientes al convento, actualmente se puede observar el templo de San Felipe de Jesús, el edificio de High Life de capital judío, la librería del Fondo de Cultura Económica, oficinas del Gobierno del Distrito Federal, la Iglesia Metodista que compró el claustro, la pastelería Ideal, incluso una gran tienda de artículos sexuales y el conocido cine Saboy - Dónde está la torre Latinoamericana, ¿qué había entonces? - Bueno, ahí no hay problema, ese sigue siendo como nuestro campanario. Un bonito y gigantesco campanario, comenta risueño, espontáneo y resignado fray Roberto Rosas, en alusión a las iglesias franciscanas del siglo XVI y XVII, cuyos campanarios eran construidos en forma de columna y a cierta distancia de los templos. Parish San Francisco El Grande Seconded Rodolfo Maldonado Uribe Fray R.P. Jesus Jasso Abundis Madero Street No 7 Col. Centro C.P. 6000 Del. Cuauhtémoc Phone 5521-7331 Phone 5518-4690 At number 7 of Madero Avenue, a few steps from the Central Axis, is one of the most historic buildings representing continental evangelization: the Temple of San Francisco el Grande, memory of what was a majestic convent of work first Franciscan friars who came to New Spain and where they departed on a mission to the south and north America. The temple of San Francisco was built on land previously in that place was a zoo of Emperor Moctezuma yielded to this religious order by the conquistador Hernán Cortés. Construction began in 1525 almost on par with a chapel called San José de los Naturales, where Peter of Ghent, one of the three preachers who came to New Spain in 1523, a year before the first 12 Franciscans arrive- lifted the College of Arts and Crafts for Indians. Over the years, around the church of San Francisco the Order of Friars Minor, official name of the Franciscan-built six chapels. The last one, dedicated to the Virgin of Valvanera which was finished in the mid-eighteenth century and currently is the only one survives. The rise The church of San Francisco and the adjoining chapels, together with orchards, gardens, the Pantheon, the cloisters and many other buildings were part of what was known as the Convent of San Francisco in Mexico, explains Fr Roberto Rosas, current responsible for the temple. He adds: Unfortunately, over the centuries the convent suffered countless landslides, reconstructions and expropriation, so that today only the church is the Chapel of Valvanera. The present church of San Francisco has also changed. Actually this is the third building. The first point the Franciscan religious collapsed before age 50 and rose a new. Later, in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century, due to floods and earthquakes, the temple was practically unusable and had to be torn down to build the current. This was dedicated to the early eighteenth century. Falling By 1860, during the reform laws, began the construction of streets and avenues, which resulted in the devastation of parts of the monastery, including the cemetery, where the remains were taken from the first 12 Franciscans who came to the New Spain. They took the bodies and never knew where they were thrown threw surely regrets the friar. After the expropriation of the convent, which occurred in 1864, it was split: the land was divided into lots that were sold to individuals and chapels were demolished almost entirely. The church and the chapel of Valvanera, now known as Guadalupe Chapel, survived thanks to their acquisition by a group of Americans who attempted to form their own religion, but the failure of the same, both buildings were sold to a committee of ladies Catholic Church subsequently yielded to. The church and the chapel were guarded by the Jesuits for some time until they returned in 1949 at the hands of the Franciscans. Thereafter, Mesa Fray Albino Castro began beautifying the grounds that had been recovered in ruins after having served as stables, circus and other things. The ruins Roberto Rosas Fray recounts the missing buildings and how they have transformed these spaces, where they were formerly chapels and other buildings belonging to the convent, now you can see the church of San Felipe de Jesus, the building High Life Jewish capital, Seller of Economic Culture Fund, Office of the Federal District, the Methodist Church bought the cloister, the pastry Ideal, even great sex shop and cinema known Saboy - Where is the Torre Latinoamericana, what was there then? - Well, there's no problem, that remains as our bell. Nice giant bell says smiling, spontaneous and resigned Brother Roberto Rosas, referring to the Franciscan churches of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, whose towers were built in a column and some distance from the temples.",arquidiócesis primada de méxico

2452532429,London City Hall,"City Hall in London is the headquarters of the Greater London Authority and the Mayor of London. It stands on the south bank of the River Thames, in the More London development by Tower Bridge. Designed by Norman Foster, it opened in July 2002. The building has an unusual bulbous shape, intended to reduce the building's surface area and thus improve energy efficiency. It has been compared variously to Darth Vader's helmet, a misshapen egg, a woodlouse or a motorcycle helmet. London Mayor Ken Livingstone referred to it as a ""glass testicle"". Its designers reportedly saw the building as a giant sphere hanging over the Thames, but opted for a more conventionally rooted building instead. The building has no front or back on conventional terms but derives its shape from a modified sphere. City Hall was constructed on a site formerly occupied by wharves serving the Pool of London. The building does not belong to the GLA but is leased under a 25-year rent. It forms part of a larger development called More London, including offices and shops. Next to City Hall is a sunken amphitheatre called The Scoop, which is used in the summer months for open-air performances; it is not, however, part of the GLA's jurisdiction. A 500 metre (1,640 foot) helical walkway, reminiscent of that in New York's Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum ascends the full height of the building. At the top of the ten-story building is an exhibition and meeting space called ""London's Living Room,"" with an open viewing deck which is occasionally open to the public. The walkway provides views of the interior of the building, and is intended to symbolise transparency; a similar device was used by Foster in his design for the rebuilt Reichstag in Germany. In 2006 it was announced that Solar photovoltaic cells would be fitted to the building by the London Climate Change Agency. Thanks to Wikipedia for the text.

2367763520,Naval traffic / Tráfico naval,"Cubelles, Barcelona (Spain). View Large On White ENGLISH The reclaimed wetlands of the river Foix estuary have made this area into one of the main attractions of the town. The River Foix, which is dry during most of the year due to construction of the Foix Resservoir is another of the most emblematic places in Cubelles. At the Foix estuary, you can spend the day enjoying nature and birthwatching, or at one of the picnic areas. This zone is also intended for school visits, as it is a place where children can study the ecosystem of a Mediterranean river such as the Foix. The estuary is separated from the sea by a sand barrier which has accumulated over time, due to sea currents and rainwater sediments, forming freshwater laguens behind the barrier. The natural area of the Foix Delta has a branch of land that sticks out into the sea. This was formed during the floods of 1994 and joins onto another branch, leaving an island in the middle. Tourists can visit the island by crossing a wooden footbridge. Source: www.cubelles.net/docs/20050211004068.htm ---------------------------------- CASTELLANO La recuperación de los espacios húmedos de la desembocadura del río Foix ha convertido la zona en una de las de mayor atractivo del municipio. El río Foix -que desde la construcción del pantano del Foix está la mayor parte del año seco- es otro de los elementos más emblemáticos de los cubellenses. En la desembocadura del Foix, además de poder pasar un día rodeado de la Naturaleza, se puede observar el comportamiento de las aves autóctonas de esta zona o disfrutar de las áreas de picnic. El espacio también está dirigido a las escuelas, que pueden visitar y estudiar el ecosistema de un río mediterráneo, como es el del Foix. Su desembocadura está separada del mar por una barrera de arena acumulada por las corrientes marítimas y los depósitos pluviales, formando lagunas de agua dulce en su interior. El Espacio Natural del Delta del Foix, mantiene el brazo de salida al mar que se formó por las riadas de 1994, a la que se ha añadido un segundo brazo dejando una isla en el medio, conectada con la zona de entretenimiento a través de unas pasarelas de madera. Otra pasarela de madera sobre uno de los brazos del río, sirve de punto de observación del desarrollo natural de la desembocadura del Foix.

Before 1912 the stage road north followed the present Sherwood Road, avoiding the wetlands and seasonal flooding at the north end of Little Lake Valley. From 1912 to 1918, the road north turned at Commercial Street and followed the hills on the east side of the valley (how called Reynolds Highway) to a new northward course along Outlet Creek. In 1918, the present route along the west side of the valley was opened and connected to a new ""Oil Well Hill grade"" just north of the valley.

3450968968,Schlüsselburg - Lnáře Municipality. Former Prachens province in the southwest of Bohemia.,"Schlüsselburg - Lnáře Municipality. Former Prachens province in the southwestern Bohemia/CZE. Schlüsselburg - Lnáře - Town of Lnar Municipality It lies in the northwestern part of Prachens province, some 50 km to the southeast from PILSEN or 100 km southwards from PRAGUE. The easiest way how to reach the locality is to follow international route E49 from Pilsen to [Bohemian] Budweis. Municipality was mentioned for the first time in the start of the 14th century AD, yet it has been inhabited continually since the 7.-6. century BC by Celts, Marcomans, Doudlebs and their posterity. First knights of Schlüsselburg were an aristocracy of German origin residing at so-called ‚Old Stronghold‘ near a passing of Smolivec Brook en route from the Pisek City to the Pilsen City. Why two names? That’s quite simple – the German name is probably older and means ‚The Key Fort‘, for a legendary golden key was found on the site of fort on the day of St. Mary. The Bohemian name is far less romantic – a flix plant [used as material by common people for their clothing ] was grown here in a large quantity, therefore Lnare means ‚Flix-growers’municipality‘. The English name ‚Town of Lnar‘ could be still find on a 1945 WWII memorial in the centre. The ancient Prachens Region had had its first centre in Prachens [Horazdovice, 20km to the south], than for centuries in Pisek City until the 19th century. Schlüsselburg was a village drowned in „sea of woods“ on the shores of muddy streams in a vast swampland, which actually covered much of nowadays Blatna Valley. This bogs had been (similarily to another famous lake district town of Wittingau-Trebon) transformed into a very extensive lakeland with hundreds of ponds and lakes. Not only these new semi-artificial lakes protected municipality from health issues connected to bogs and severe floods, but enabled growth of famed fishing industry, major source of revenues until quite recently. After 17th century some decline in fishing industry occurred and much of the waters were drained for new, prospective usage – sheep pastures. As of 1840 there were some 13,000 sheep. Second revival of the fishing industry occured during the 19th century, thanks to the care of local aristocracy. In the 19th century Dr. Theodor Mokry created a breed of an unscaly carp called ‚Lnarsky modrak‘ (‚Bluefish of Lnare‘). A wave of modernity arrived with first train on a brand line between towns Blatná and Pomuk-Dvorec some hundred years ago. Unfortunately for the municipality this train line eased a dramatical outflow of locals into fast growing metropolis of West Bohemian Region, Pilsen. After 1918 the municipality became part of Czechoslovakia, later of Protectorate ‘Böhmen und Mähren‘ and after 1948 part of Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The winter Velvet Revolution of 1989 brought an end to this totalitarian state and we are enjoying first 20 years of cultural, social and economic revival. Our two chateaux returned to local hands; the larger ‚New‘, to non-aristocratic Vanicek Family and the ‚Old‘ one belongs to the municipality. Devastating floods in August 2002 damaged strongly our valley but we succeeded in rebuilding all of it during 2002-2004. We are pleased to welcome more and more European newcomers [settlers] and visitou every year. Thank You for Your favour ;-) Municipality is rich in architecture, unique landscape and sights, for example: Baroque church of St. Joseph [17. century] with very unique fresco paintings Baroque Chateau [or ‚New Chateau‘, 17. century] - frescoes with mythical ancient Gods, English-French garden [4 hect.] with a little mosque, several stone fountains, pools and rare wood species… Chapel of St. Anna [end of the 17. cent.] Annaberg - complex of frame houses, first half of the 19. cent. (in the style of SW German Swabia) ‚Old Stronghold‘ - at least 700 years old remnant of original wooden fort , rebuilt in 1597 as a stone-brick Renaissance chateau; first mentioned in 1465. Now hosts a gallery of contemporary art, infocentre, and flats. Monumental classical barnyard from the 19. century Primary school, more than 110 years old Parish & monastery Church of the Saintest Trinity with the icon of Our Mother of Lnar [17. cent.] Gothical grave-yard Church of St. Nicholas [14. cent.] Baroque Chapel in Zahorcice [17. cent.] Baroque sculptures of saint protectors [at least 9 of them] Baroque sculptures of [11 pieces, 17. century] The Giant Logan [some 30 tons, 5 km to the south in Kadov; protected by the law. The biggest and perhaps the most easily accessible in all Bohemia] Perfect organised pathways/cycleways with infopanels through the countryside For Geochaching lovers – few caches are to be found here as well ;-) plus a great wealth of protected lakes, meadows, woods, castles, churches....

The media has shared images of destruction that are hard to comprehend and are often incredibly personal and intrusive. It's taken me a fortnight to want to record anything to do with the floods; the heartbreak is too raw. Yes,it is devastating that the Bundaberg Junior Cricket grounds at Kendall's Flats has once again been destroyed, but we know it is only temporary.

3450964944,Schlüsselburg - Lnáře Municipality. Former Prachens province in the southwest of Bohemia.,"Schlüsselburg - Lnáře Municipality. Former Prachens province in the southwestern Bohemia/CZE. Schlüsselburg - Lnáře - Town of Lnar Municipality It lies in the northwestern part of Prachens province, some 50 km to the southeast from PILSEN or 100 km southwards from PRAGUE. The easiest way how to reach the locality is to follow international route E49 from Pilsen to [Bohemian] Budweis. Municipality was mentioned for the first time in the start of the 14th century AD, yet it has been inhabited continually since the 7.-6. century BC by Celts, Marcomans, Doudlebs and their posterity. First knights of Schlüsselburg were an aristocracy of German origin residing at so-called ‚Old Stronghold‘ near a passing of Smolivec Brook en route from the Pisek City to the Pilsen City. Why two names? That’s quite simple – the German name is probably older and means ‚The Key Fort‘, for a legendary golden key was found on the site of fort on the day of St. Mary. The Bohemian name is far less romantic – a flix plant [used as material by common people for their clothing ] was grown here in a large quantity, therefore Lnare means ‚Flix-growers’municipality‘. The English name ‚Town of Lnar‘ could be still find on a 1945 WWII memorial in the centre. The ancient Prachens Region had had its first centre in Prachens [Horazdovice, 20km to the south], than for centuries in Pisek City until the 19th century. Schlüsselburg was a village drowned in „sea of woods“ on the shores of muddy streams in a vast swampland, which actually covered much of nowadays Blatna Valley. This bogs had been (similarily to another famous lake district town of Wittingau-Trebon) transformed into a very extensive lakeland with hundreds of ponds and lakes. Not only these new semi-artificial lakes protected municipality from health issues connected to bogs and severe floods, but enabled growth of famed fishing industry, major source of revenues until quite recently. After 17th century some decline in fishing industry occurred and much of the waters were drained for new, prospective usage – sheep pastures. As of 1840 there were some 13,000 sheep. Second revival of the fishing industry occured during the 19th century, thanks to the care of local aristocracy. In the 19th century Dr. Theodor Mokry created a breed of an unscaly carp called ‚Lnarsky modrak‘ (‚Bluefish of Lnare‘). A wave of modernity arrived with first train on a brand line between towns Blatná and Pomuk-Dvorec some hundred years ago. Unfortunately for the municipality this train line eased a dramatical outflow of locals into fast growing metropolis of West Bohemian Region, Pilsen. After 1918 the municipality became part of Czechoslovakia, later of Protectorate ‘Böhmen und Mähren‘ and after 1948 part of Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The winter Velvet Revolution of 1989 brought an end to this totalitarian state and we are enjoying first 20 years of cultural, social and economic revival. Our two chateaux returned to local hands; the larger ‚New‘, to non-aristocratic Vanicek Family and the ‚Old‘ one belongs to the municipality. Devastating floods in August 2002 damaged strongly our valley but we succeeded in rebuilding all of it during 2002-2004. We are pleased to welcome more and more European newcomers [settlers] and visitou every year. Thank You for Your favour ;-) Municipality is rich in architecture, unique landscape and sights, for example: Baroque church of St. Joseph [17. century] with very unique fresco paintings Baroque Chateau [or ‚New Chateau‘, 17. century] - frescoes with mythical ancient Gods, English-French garden [4 hect.] with a little mosque, several stone fountains, pools and rare wood species… Chapel of St. Anna [end of the 17. cent.] Annaberg - complex of frame houses, first half of the 19. cent. (in the style of SW German Swabia) ‚Old Stronghold‘ - at least 700 years old remnant of original wooden fort , rebuilt in 1597 as a stone-brick Renaissance chateau; first mentioned in 1465. Now hosts a gallery of contemporary art, infocentre, and flats. Monumental classical barnyard from the 19. century Primary school, more than 110 years old Parish & monastery Church of the Saintest Trinity with the icon of Our Mother of Lnar [17. cent.] Gothical grave-yard Church of St. Nicholas [14. cent.] Baroque Chapel in Zahorcice [17. cent.] Baroque sculptures of saint protectors [at least 9 of them] Baroque sculptures of [11 pieces, 17. century] The Giant Logan [some 30 tons, 5 km to the south in Kadov; protected by the law. The biggest and perhaps the most easily accessible in all Bohemia] Perfect organised pathways/cycleways with infopanels through the countryside For Geochaching lovers – few caches are to be found here as well ;-) plus a great wealth of protected lakes, meadows, woods, castles, churches....

The mine, built in the 13th century, produced table salt continuously until 2007, as one of the world's oldest salt mines still in operation. From its beginning and throughout its existence, the Royal mine was run by the Żupy krakowskie Salt Mines. Commercial mining was discontinued in 1996 due to low salt prices and mine flooding. The mine's attractions include dozens of statues, three chapels and an entire cathedral that has been carved out of the rock salt by the miners. The oldest sculptures are augmented by the new carvings by contemporary artists.

At first I thought it might be a moose, but when it blasted through the main channel of the Tchaikazan without even slowing down we knew it was a very big bear. Once he reached the swimming holes he began to play, diving into a grizzly bear sized puddle, then without pause shooting a few meters across the gravel and right into the next water hole, then the next, then another, leaving a rooster tail of water behind him as he went, playing around like a hyperactive dog. Finally he noticed us, stood on his hind legs for a better view, then took off like a shot moving at full speed for the nearest cover of the trees.",

7826894062,9th (Scottish) Division Memorial - Point du Jour - Pas-de-Calais,"The memorial commemorates the part played by the 9th Scottish Division in the Battle of Arras on 9th April 1917. The division was serving in the XVII Corps in the British Third Army. The 9th (Scottish) Division was on the right wing of the XVII Corps attack, with the 4th, 34th, 51st Divisions to its left. The Canadian Corps was over on the far left of these British divisions at the Vimy Ridge. The VI Corps was on the right of the 9th Division on the southern side of the the Scarpe river. Point du Jour was the name of a house on the road between St. Laurent-Blangy and Gavrelle. In German occupied ground it had been fortified into a redoubt by the time the British attacked the area in April 1917. On 9th April 1917 the house called Point du Jour was captured by the 34th Division. The memorial to the 9th Scottish Division was unveiled on 9th April 1922, the fifth anniversary of the battle. It was originally located on a site which later had the carriageways of the D950 dual carriageway built either side of it. In 2006 it was moved stone by stone a few hundred metres to the south side of the westbound carriageway of the D950. This was considered to be a much safer site for visitors, and it is now situated next to the Point du Jour British Military Cemetery. In addition to the battle honours of the division in France and Flanders the text of remembrance inscribed on the memorial reads: Inscription on the 9th Scottish Division memorial. REMEMBER WITH HONOUR THE 9th SCOTTISH DIVISION WHO ON THE FIELDS OF FRANCE AND FLANDERS 1915-1918 SERVED WELL 9th Scottish Division Memorial Location The memorial used to be located between the two carriageways of the D950, but has now been moved to a location next to the Point du Jour British Militay Cemetery north of the village of Athies. From the main road through Athies, the Rue d'Arras, follow the Commonwealth War Graves Commission sign at the Rue de Chauffour for the Point du Jour British Military Cemetery. This road will take you through the north side of the village. The road becomes a single track road and after leaving the village in about 600 metres you will reach the memorial and the military cemetery.","(scottish), 9th, division, du, jour, memorial, pas-de-calais, point"

4159743249,Monte São Miguel / St. Michael's Mount,"Monte São Miguel, Cornualha, Inglaterra. St Michael's Mount (Cornish: Karrek Loos y'n Koos) is a tidal island located 366 m (400 yd) off the Mount's Bay coast of Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is united with the town of Marazion by a man-made causeway, passable only at mid to low tide, made of granite setts. The island exhibits a combination of slate and granite. Its Cornish language name — literally, ""the grey rock in the wood"" — may represent a folk memory of a time before Mount's Bay was flooded. Certainly, the Cornish name would be an accurate description of the Mount set in woodland. Remains of trees have been seen at low tides following storms on the beach at Perranuthnoe, but radiocarbon dating established the submerging of the hazel wood at about 1700 BC. The chronicler John of Worcester relates under the year 1099 that St. Michael's Mount was located five or six miles from the sea, enclosed in a thick wood, but that on the third day of the nones of November the sea overflowed the land, destroying many towns and drowning many people as well as innumerable oxen and sheep; the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records under the date 11 November 1199, ""The sea-flood sprung up to such a height, and did so much harm, as no man remembered that it ever did before"". The Cornish legend of Lyonesse, an ancient kingdom said to have extended from Penwith toward the Isles of Scilly, also talks of land being inundated by the sea. In prehistoric times, St. Michael's Mount may have been a port for the tin trade, and Gavin de Beer made a case for it to be identified with the ""tin port"" Ictis/Ictin mentioned by Posidonius. Historically, St Michael's Mount was a Cornish counterpart of Mont Saint Michel in Normandy, France. St Michael's Mount is known colloquially by locals as simply the Mount. Wikipedia","cornuália, cornualha, cornwall, england, inglaterra, michael, miguel, monte, mount, são, saint, st. michael's mount"

6023980172,Paddle the LA River,"Pilot boating program charts course for future use LOS ANGELES - Guides from the Los Angeles Conservation Corps' ""Paddle the LA River"" escorted a mix of project partners, politicians and journalists for the inaugural LA River tour Aug. 8. Results from the seven week pilot program will quantify the feasibility of seasonal non-motorized boating. ""Providing safe and healthy recreation experiences to meet the needs of current and future generations is part of the Corps' Recreation Strategic Plan,"" said Col. Mark Toy, Los Angeles District Commander. ""But I must be clear, nothing we do can jeopardize human safety or reduce the flood carrying capacity of this river."" Accompanying the group was Fernando Gomez of the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority. He is a law enforcement ranger and the guide supervisor for this program. His team is swift water certified and their kayaks are prepared for any emergency from band aide to defibrillator. ""We want to provide a safe environment for everyone to enjoy, something that's brand new, it's a pilot program that we want to go even further,"" Gomez said. ""We are fortunate to be partnered with the Conservation Corps and the Army Corps of Engineers; this should be one of the things that people can enjoy... the LA River."" Weekends through Sept. 25 the LACC offers two educational trips a day down a 1.5 mile stretch of the Los Angeles River within the Sepulveda Basin. Groups are limited to 10 for each tour and there is a $50 per person fee. The minimum age is ten. Those 18 and under must be accompanied by a guardian. Nationwide the Corps of Engineers is a major federal, water-based recreation provider, host to more than 370 million visitors annually. The Los Angeles River at Sepulveda Dam sees more than 7 million visitors annually. ""We recognize the critical role we have in balancing our responsibilities among increasing interests in recreational opportunities along this great river,"" added Toy. ""We are proud of these facts and we continue to work diligently with our partners and stakeholders on future opportunities for recreation and revitalization along the river.""

9061695300,"Ledson Winery and Vineyards, Santa Rosa, California, USA","Ledson Winery and Vineyards, Santa Rosa, California, USA Ledson Winery and Vineyards : When the Ledson family started construction in 1989, they thought the property would be ideal for their residence. They planted 17 acres of Merlot and began work on the house. As the months passed, the turrets, slate roofs, balconies and fountains took shape and passers-by started to take notice, some going so far as to climb the fences to get a better look. The family eventually realized that it was time to rethink the plan. Given the intense public interest in the building and the quality of the Merlot harvested from the estate vineyard - which had been sold to nearby wineries - they decided to turn the home into a winery and tasting room. In 1997 the family released their first wine, the 1994 Ledson Estate Merlot and in 1999 after two years of reconstruction, the winery opened its doors to the public. An instant landmark, Ledson Winery, known as “The Castle” around the globe, is an architectural showpiece. The 16,000 square foot French Normandy structure was designed entirely by Steve Ledson and features sweeping staircases, marble fireplaces, cathedral-style windows, coffered ceilings, several tasting bars, luxuriously appointed bridal suites and over five miles of ornate wood inlays and mosaics, which were hand cut and installed by Steve's son, Mike. The Castle provides a stunning setting for wine tasting weekends, romantic getaways and executive retreats.","grapes, kenwood, ledson, ledson vineyards, ledson winery, ledson winery and vineyards, sonoma, sonoma valley, vineyards, winery"
5951436978,Providing clean water to millions of people,"In 2010 Pakistan was hit by one of the largest natural disasters the world has ever seen. Ten years' worth of rain falling in just two weeks resulted in extreme flooding across much of the country. A staggering 14 million people were forced to flee their homes, thousands of schools were destroyed, and agriculture was wiped out across vast areas. The UK responded swiftly and significantly. UK aid helped millions of people, initially by providing emergency shelter, food, healthcare, clean drinking water and sanitation. Later it helped people to rebuild their lives and become self-sufficient again by constructing flood resistant brick homes, replacing bridges and schools, and providing seeds, livestock, jobs and tools. All this will help reduce long term dependency on aid. Emergency aid from the UK has included providing: - Clean water to around 2.4 million people - Toilets and sanitation to some 1.2 million people - Heath and hygiene education to around 2.5 million people on how to avoid potentially fatal diseases - Shelter to more than one million people, including 13,400 flood resistant brick houses, each big enough to house a family of up to eight people - Wheat and vegetable seeds, fertiliser, animal feed and veterinary services to approx 895,000 people - 200,000 children with education by repairing schools, as well as accelerating a project to build forty new schools in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa benefitting another 9,000 boys and girls To find out more about how the UK is helping in Pakistan, please visit: www.dfid.gov.uk/Media-Room/Features/2011/Pakistan-floods-... Image credit: Vicki Francis/Department for International Development Terms of use This image is posted under a Creative Commons - Attribution Licence, in accordance with the Open Government Licence.

He also welcomed Croatia's forthcoming accession to the European Union, but pointed out that the Council had yet to keep its promise to deliver fresh EU funding for it. Parliament will keep its vote on this funding on the agenda until Thursday, to give the Council time to do so, he added.

8010064020,Copenhagen - Strøget,"Strøget is a carfree zone in Copenhagen, Denmark. This popular tourist attraction in the centre of town is the longest pedestrian shopping area in Europe. The street is bound on the west by The City Hall Square (Danish: Rådhuspladsen), the central town square by Copenhagen City Hall, and on the east by Kongens Nytorv (""The King's New Square""), another large square at the other end. But the Strøget area is actually a collection of streets that spread out from this central thoroughfare. Many of the city's most famous and expensive stores, such as Illums Bolighus, Magasin du Nord, the Royal Copenhagen Porcelain Factory, and chain stores, are located along the strip. There are also a multitude of souvenir shops and fast food outlets. Strøget was created in November 1962 when cars were beginning to dominate Copenhagen's old central streets.[2] During the 1950s the street had closed to traffic for a couple of days at Christmas. In 1962 the closure was ""half disguised"" as an extended holiday closure, but the road has remained closed since. The idea was controversial, some people believing that the Danes did not have the mentality for ""public life"" envisioned by such a street, and many local merchants believed the move would scare away business. However it proved a success, and the area soon boasted more shoppers, cafes, and a renewed street life. Building on Strøget’s success, the network expanded piecemeal – another street and a few more squares were emptied of cars in 1968, and further closures took place in 1973, 1980, and 1992. From the initial 15,800 square metres of the Strøget, Copenhagen’s pedestrian network has expanded to about 100,000 square metres. The idea has become a model often emulated elsewhere. Danish architect and urban planner Jan Gehl has been instrumental in the creation of this pedestrian zone.","copenhagen, cph, d5100, danimarca, danmark, hdr, københavn, nikon, strøget"

All were built by migrant workers. All the workers knew that they would never have an apartment or have a job in the buildings they built. They get to go home to their villages once a year at Chinese New Year to see their wives and children. Their wives are also away from their villages, serving in cities as maids or waitresses. Their one child is raised in the village by the grandparents. There is no work in the villages with enough pay to get along, hence the migrant life.

This shape is unique among all other termite mounds which are always more or less spherical and many hypotheses have been advanced to explain the remarkable shape and orientation. Most of these investigations focus on the orientation, but the biological significance of the shape is rarely explored. The currently accepted hypothesis considers shape and orientation as adaptation to maintain a thermo stable eastern face. In contrast to this we consider habitat conditions, such as heavy rainfalls and regularly flooding in the wet season, as most important for the evolution of this shape. iussi.confex.com/iussi/2006/techprogram/P1435.HTM i09_0501 041 Kingdom:Animalia Phylum:Arthropoda Class:Insecta Subclass:Pterygota Infraclass:Neoptera Superorder:Dictyoptera Order:Isoptera Family: Termitidae Litchfield National Park, Northern Territory, Australia i09_0501 030","amitermes, amitermes meridionalis, animalia, architecture, arthropoda, australia, blattodea, blattoidea, colony, design, dictyoptera, eusociality, grass, habitat, insect, insecta, isoptera, litchfield national park, nature, neoptera, northern territory, pterygota, society, superorganism, termite, termitidae, termitoidae"

The are also two biggish buildings (I have no idea what the were for) and several small buildings. There are various plans for the site - including a nature reserve, and a landfill site (fiercely objected to by local residents). In reality, nothing will probably happen. The towers still survive because it is feared that any explosion caused would rupture the banks of the nearby canal. The station has been closed since 1994 and the 45 acres (18 ha) site was accquired by Able UK in 1995.[2] Much of the station has been demolished and now only its six cooling towers (each 340 ft (100 m) high and 260 ft (79 m) in diameter at the base), two ash slurry hoppers, railway sidings and the station's large adjacent electricity switching station still remain. The switching station was nearly flooded during the 2007 Yorkshire flood, which would have knocked the grid out according to news reports. The structures still stand now because it is feared that any explosion would cause the banks of the nearby canal to rupture.[3] They also contain asbestos, which would contaminate land for miles around the site. There have been several controversial proposals for the site, including a car distribution depot and more recently a huge landfill site, neither of which have proven popular with the local residents.

Along the way I documented as best I could the activity and devestation around me. I dedicate these images to the people whose lives have been disrupted so suddenly by this natural disaster. I hope the record serves to remind as both of the suffering that has been caused, and the incredible sense of solidarity shown by Queenslanders to eachother in this hour of need. In the coming days and months, support will be needed more than ever. Let's not forget. As I pulled up to park ready to volunteer, I noticed the car in front of me was also a red 206. A slightly different red, and a five door, but never the less a good sign I was in the right place.","12mp, 2011, 206, brisbane, cameraphone, car, ericsson, flood, gti, january, peugeot, satio, sony, weather"

3450146609,Schlüsselburg - Lnáře Municipality. Former Prachens province in the southwest of Bohemia.,"Schlüsselburg - Lnáře Municipality. Former Prachens province in the southwestern Bohemia/CZE. Schlüsselburg - Lnáře - Town of Lnar Municipality It lies in the northwestern part of Prachens province, some 50 km to the southeast from PILSEN or 100 km southwards from PRAGUE. The easiest way how to reach the locality is to follow international route E49 from Pilsen to [Bohemian] Budweis. Municipality was mentioned for the first time in the start of the 14th century AD, yet it has been inhabited continually since the 7.-6. century BC by Celts, Marcomans, Doudlebs and their posterity. First knights of Schlüsselburg were an aristocracy of German origin residing at so-called ‚Old Stronghold‘ near a passing of Smolivec Brook en route from the Pisek City to the Pilsen City. Why two names? That’s quite simple – the German name is probably older and means ‚The Key Fort‘, for a legendary golden key was found on the site of fort on the day of St. Mary. The Bohemian name is far less romantic – a flix plant [used as material by common people for their clothing ] was grown here in a large quantity, therefore Lnare means ‚Flix-growers’municipality‘. The English name ‚Town of Lnar‘ could be still find on a 1945 WWII memorial in the centre. The ancient Prachens Region had had its first centre in Prachens [Horazdovice, 20km to the south], than for centuries in Pisek City until the 19th century. Schlüsselburg was a village drowned in „sea of woods“ on the shores of muddy streams in a vast swampland, which actually covered much of nowadays Blatna Valley. This bogs had been (similarily to another famous lake district town of Wittingau-Trebon) transformed into a very extensive lakeland with hundreds of ponds and lakes. Not only these new semi-artificial lakes protected municipality from health issues connected to bogs and severe floods, but enabled growth of famed fishing industry, major source of revenues until quite recently. After 17th century some decline in fishing industry occurred and much of the waters were drained for new, prospective usage – sheep pastures. As of 1840 there were some 13,000 sheep. Second revival of the fishing industry occured during the 19th century, thanks to the care of local aristocracy. In the 19th century Dr. Theodor Mokry created a breed of an unscaly carp called ‚Lnarsky modrak‘ (‚Bluefish of Lnare‘). A wave of modernity arrived with first train on a brand line between towns Blatná and Pomuk-Dvorec some hundred years ago. Unfortunately for the municipality this train line eased a dramatical outflow of locals into fast growing metropolis of West Bohemian Region, Pilsen. After 1918 the municipality became part of Czechoslovakia, later of Protectorate ‘Böhmen und Mähren‘ and after 1948 part of Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The winter Velvet Revolution of 1989 brought an end to this totalitarian state and we are enjoying first 20 years of cultural, social and economic revival. Our two chateaux returned to local hands; the larger ‚New‘, to non-aristocratic Vanicek Family and the ‚Old‘ one belongs to the municipality. Devastating floods in August 2002 damaged strongly our valley but we succeeded in rebuilding all of it during 2002-2004. We are pleased to welcome more and more European newcomers [settlers] and visitou every year. Thank You for Your favour ;-) Municipality is rich in architecture, unique landscape and sights, for example: Baroque church of St. Joseph [17. century] with very unique fresco paintings Baroque Chateau [or ‚New Chateau‘, 17. century] - frescoes with mythical ancient Gods, English-French garden [4 hect.] with a little mosque, several stone fountains, pools and rare wood species… Chapel of St. Anna [end of the 17. cent.] Annaberg - complex of frame houses, first half of the 19. cent. (in the style of SW German Swabia) ‚Old Stronghold‘ - at least 700 years old remnant of original wooden fort , rebuilt in 1597 as a stone-brick Renaissance chateau; first mentioned in 1465. Now hosts a gallery of contemporary art, infocentre, and flats. Monumental classical barnyard from the 19. century Primary school, more than 110 years old Parish & monastery Church of the Saintest Trinity with the icon of Our Mother of Lnar [17. cent.] Gothical grave-yard Church of St. Nicholas [14. cent.] Baroque Chapel in Zahorcice [17. cent.] Baroque sculptures of saint protectors [at least 9 of them] Baroque sculptures of [11 pieces, 17. century] The Giant Logan [some 30 tons, 5 km to the south in Kadov; protected by the law. The biggest and perhaps the most easily accessible in all Bohemia] Perfect organised pathways/cycleways with infopanels through the countryside For Geochaching lovers – few caches are to be found here as well ;-) plus a great wealth of protected lakes, meadows, woods, castles, churches....

But by the time I emerged back into daylight, a minute or two later, at least a hundred middle-school-aged kids had flooded into the central paved area. I figured they must be there for recess, about to start playing some game. But then I thought I noticed a flailing of limbs and hair somewhere in the center of the mob. Were two girls fighting each other? Glancing to my left, I noticed a Parks employee standing idly by, watching the action like it was a TV show. A few moments later, two or three police officers came chugging into the playground on foot. The kids took off running and screaming in all directions, evaporating in a chaotic preadolescent whirlwind that made it impossible to determine who had been involved in the fracas. A minute later the playground was empty again. I walked over to talk to the Parks lady, to verify that I had not just been hallucinating. She said these fights happen all the time once the weather warms up. The kids apparently use this playground as their standard dueling grounds, and hordes of them show up just after school lets out every time a fight is rumored. No one's been seriously hurt so far, but she's always worried someone's going to pull out a gun borrowed from some ""crazy uncle"".","nyc, xmap"

8508008709,Sacramento City Market Ruins,"Located on the floodplain of the Sacramento River Delta, the City of Sacramento had a penchant for flooding in the winter. The worst however was the Great Flood of 1862, which inundated areas throughout the Western United States, destroying Columbia River towns in Oregon and Gold Rush towns in California and Colorado. Worst hit however was the Central Valley of California, which became a lake 480km in length and 32km in width. The levees built by Sacramento to keep out the river ironically caused all of the rainwater upstream to accumulate in the city's makeshift dams, covering the city in more than 3m of water. After the flooding, the city began to elevate buildings by simply building additional stories on existing buildings, covering the lower areas with wooden planking sidewalks. Over average, the buildings were elevated some 4m, creating the legendary ""Underground Sacramento"". Some of the areas have now been restored and are open to tours. Built in 1849, the City Market was a butcher's shop. It remains in its original elevation, some three meters below the current ground level. The building was demolished in 1960s redevelopment, leaving these impressive iron-cast pillars made in 1869. The ruins are now a small ""Pioneer Park"".

It depicts the opening scene of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and was made by the local sculpture Edwin Russell in 1984. It stands on what once was an island called ""Westnye"" or later ""Bennets Island"". A channel once ran where the roadway is now, which served as the millstream for Artington Mill, which stood where the White House is now. The riverside meadow belonging to this mill was known as Millmead. The mill closed in the 17th. century and the stream was filled in during the 18th. The name of the island is commemorated in Westnye Gardens, which has an interesting sundial. on this side of St. Nicholas Church is the glass wall of the Parish Room built in 1977. There is a memorial to Dr. John Monsell, Rector of St. Nicholas and author of such hymns as ""Fight The Good Fight"", who died in 1875 during the building of the present Church. Below the old bridge can be seen the sandy riverbed that may have inspired the town's Saxon name, Gyldaford - ""the Golden Ford"". Until the 1960's Moon's timber yard stood there, across the river. In the flood of 1900, planks floating downstream became jammed under the arches of the ancient bridge and the pressure of water caused the stonework to collapse. A single arch iron bridge was built in 1902.","alice, alice in wonderland, edwin russell, england, guildford, lewis carroll, millmead, plaque, river wey, surrey, westnye, white rabbit"

469539588,NYC - Bronx - Bronx Zoo: Jungle World - Malayan Tapir,"The Malayan Tapir (Tapirus indicus), also called the Asian Tapir, is the largest of the four species of tapir and the only one native to Asia. The scientific name is somewhat misleading, as the Tapirus indicus is not native to India; the name refers rather to the East Indies. The Malayan Tapir was once found throughout the tropical lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, and Vietnam. However, its numbers have decreased in recent years, and today, like all tapirs, it is in danger of extinction. The main threat to the Malayan tapirs is human activity, including deforestation for agricultural purposes, flooding caused by the damming of rivers for hydroelectric projects, and illegal trade. In Thailand, a young tapir may be worth US$5500. Malayan Tapir are easily identified by its markings, most notably the light-colored “saddle” which extends from its shoulders to its rump. The rest of its hair is black, except for the tips of its ears which, as with other tapirs, are rimmed with white. This pattern is for camouflage. Malayan Tapirs grow to between 6 and 8 feet in length, stand 3 to 3.5 feet tall, and typically weigh between 550 and 700 pounds. They have small stubby tails and long, flexible proboscises. They have four toes on each front foot and three toes on each back foot. The Malayan Tapir has rather poor eyesight but excellent hearing. Malayan Tapirs are primarily solitary creatures, marking out large tracts of land as their territory by spraying urine on plants. Exclusively vegetarian, it slowly forages for the tender shoots and leaves. Despite their ungainly looks and bulk, though, the tapir can gallop through the jungle, scramble up steep slopes, and swim fast-flowing rivers. ** The Bronx Zoo, located within the Bronx Park, is the largest metropolitan zoo in the United States, comprising 265 acres of parklands and naturalistic habitats and home to over 4,000 animals. Focused on conservation, it opened on November 8, 1899, with 22 exhibits, 843 animals. The zoo's origins date back to 1895, with the establishment of the New York Zoological Society (NYZS), renamed Wild Conservation Society (WCS) in 1993. Only the outer structure of the World of Reptiles remains much as it was in 1899. With the 1941 opening of African Plains, the Bronx Zoo was one of the first U.S. zoos to move away from cages and exhibit animals in naturalistic habitats.","animal planet, asian tapir, bronx, bronx park, bronx zoo, endangered species, gothamist, jungle world, landmark, malayan tapir, new york, new york city, new york city landmarks preservation commission, new york zoological park, new york zoological society, ny, nyc, nyclpc, nyzs, park, tapir, tapirus indicus, wcs, wild conservation society, zoo"

Norman spent time in Africa and saw Muslim temples in India which led him to use Moorish architecture in the building's design. In 1945, when World War II ended, Britain resumed control again, but Malaya's independence movement had matured and organized itself in an alliance under Tunku Abdul Rahman. When the British flag was finally lowered in Kuala Lumpur's Merdeka Square in 1957, Tunku became the first prime minister of Malaya. incidents: In 1971, Kuala Lumpur suffered a huge flood after a heavy rainfall. Part of the building was not spared. In 1978, a massive renovation was undertaken. The renovation took six years to complete with a total cost of RM 17.2 million. Many historical events had been held in front of this building. Among them was the declaration of independence of Malaysia (Malaya then) on 31 August, 1957 and the lowering of the Union Jack.

5366845809,Access to healthcare after the floods,"Munawar is twenty-five years old and has been married to her husband Rashid for four years. They have two daughters and a son, and live in Sindh province, Pakistan. Sindh was badly affected by the devastating floods in July and August 2010 and, although the water is receding, parts of the province still remain underwater. Thankfully Munawar and her family managed to escape the flood water but they've been struggling with fevers, flu and chest infections ever since. Today they’re getting treatment as a mobile health clinic is in town, run by International Medical Corps and funded by UKaid from the Department for International Development. These clinics are providing vital emergency health care, hygience services and psychosocial support to thousands of families like Munawar's. ""Everyone was talking about the water coming,"" says Munawar. ""We found out in the morning that the flood had hit us. The land and roads were all sunk under water. With the grace of Allah we took our children and left."" ""It was really difficult trying to travel with the children. They all got ill and suffered from flu, vomiting, diarrhea, coughs, and chest-infection. My husband also got a fever.""""My kids cry at night and I have to look after them but I feel dizzy."" As she talks about the last few months, two of Manawar's children sit on her lap. A female doctor is examining them, looking at their skin, listening to their chests and writing prescriptions. ""I was worried about my children and about myself,"" says Munawar. “But I'm relieved that my children can see the doctor here."" Behind her more than fifty women and children gather around a female nurse. Prescriptions are written and tablets, syrups and other medicines are collected from a van which doubles as a mobile dispensary and ambulance. Munawar’s hopes for the future are simple: “As long as our home can be fixed and we can feed our children, that is enough,” she says.

3450963634,Schlüsselburg - Lnáře Municipality. Former Prachens province in the southwest of Bohemia.,"Schlüsselburg - Lnáře Municipality. Former Prachens province in the southwestern Bohemia/CZE. Schlüsselburg - Lnáře - Town of Lnar Municipality It lies in the northwestern part of Prachens province, some 50 km to the southeast from PILSEN or 100 km southwards from PRAGUE. The easiest way how to reach the locality is to follow international route E49 from Pilsen to [Bohemian] Budweis. Municipality was mentioned for the first time in the start of the 14th century AD, yet it has been inhabited continually since the 7.-6. century BC by Celts, Marcomans, Doudlebs and their posterity. First knights of Schlüsselburg were an aristocracy of German origin residing at so-called ‚Old Stronghold‘ near a passing of Smolivec Brook en route from the Pisek City to the Pilsen City. Why two names? That’s quite simple – the German name is probably older and means ‚The Key Fort‘, for a legendary golden key was found on the site of fort on the day of St. Mary. The Bohemian name is far less romantic – a flix plant [used as material by common people for their clothing ] was grown here in a large quantity, therefore Lnare means ‚Flix-growers’municipality‘. The English name ‚Town of Lnar‘ could be still find on a 1945 WWII memorial in the centre. The ancient Prachens Region had had its first centre in Prachens [Horazdovice, 20km to the south], than for centuries in Pisek City until the 19th century. Schlüsselburg was a village drowned in „sea of woods“ on the shores of muddy streams in a vast swampland, which actually covered much of nowadays Blatna Valley. This bogs had been (similarily to another famous lake district town of Wittingau-Trebon) transformed into a very extensive lakeland with hundreds of ponds and lakes. Not only these new semi-artificial lakes protected municipality from health issues connected to bogs and severe floods, but enabled growth of famed fishing industry, major source of revenues until quite recently. After 17th century some decline in fishing industry occurred and much of the waters were drained for new, prospective usage – sheep pastures. As of 1840 there were some 13,000 sheep. Second revival of the fishing industry occured during the 19th century, thanks to the care of local aristocracy. In the 19th century Dr. Theodor Mokry created a breed of an unscaly carp called ‚Lnarsky modrak‘ (‚Bluefish of Lnare‘). A wave of modernity arrived with first train on a brand line between towns Blatná and Pomuk-Dvorec some hundred years ago. Unfortunately for the municipality this train line eased a dramatical outflow of locals into fast growing metropolis of West Bohemian Region, Pilsen. After 1918 the municipality became part of Czechoslovakia, later of Protectorate ‘Böhmen und Mähren‘ and after 1948 part of Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The winter Velvet Revolution of 1989 brought an end to this totalitarian state and we are enjoying first 20 years of cultural, social and economic revival. Our two chateaux returned to local hands; the larger ‚New‘, to non-aristocratic Vanicek Family and the ‚Old‘ one belongs to the municipality. Devastating floods in August 2002 damaged strongly our valley but we succeeded in rebuilding all of it during 2002-2004. We are pleased to welcome more and more European newcomers [settlers] and visitou every year.

5014399777,Grattan Bridge (originally Essex Bridge) - Dublin,"Grattan Bridge is a road bridge joining Capel Street to Parliament Street and the south quays. About five or six years ago the city council built what was intended to be a ""European-style book market"" on the bridge. The initiative included reconstruction of the bridge deck, with granite paving for the footpaths and a set of benches with wooden seats and toughened glass backs. Following this development, several temporary kiosks built on the bridge, to create ""a contemporary version of an inhabited bridge, such as the Ponte Vecchio in Florence"". The kiosks have since been removed which is a pity as I liked them. History: The first bridge on this site was built by Sir Humphrey Jervis as Essex Bridge (named for Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland) to join several of Jervis' developments (including Capel Street and Jervis Street) to the opposite side of the river and to Dublin Castle. Essex Bridge was an arched stone structure with 7 piers, and partly constructed from the ruined masonry of nearby St. Mary’s Abbey on the northside. In the 1750's the bridge was rebuilt by George Semple, to correct flood and other structural damage and as one of the first initiatives of the Wide Streets Commission. During this construction, some original features were removed. EG: A statue, by John van Nost the Elder, of George I on horseback, was moved in 1798 to the gardens of the Mansion House. In 1937 it was bought by the Barber Institute for Fine Arts in Birmingham, in front of which it now stands. From 1872, the bridge was further remodelled (on Westminster Bridge in London), being widened and flattened with cast iron supports extended out from the stonework so as to carry pavements on either side of the roadway. The bridge was (and is still) lit by ornate lamp standards also in cast iron. The bridge was reopened as Grattan Bridge in 1874, being named after Henry Grattan MP (1746-1820).","22092010, dublin, dublin streets, infomatique, ireland, photographed by william murphy, sigma camera, statuesinfomatique, streets of dublin"

3621530307,07g Mount Lowe Railway - Greg on Wall (E),"National Register of Historic Places: 92001522, Added January 6, 1993 __________ The Mount Lowe Railway was the third in a series of scenic mountain railroads in America created as a tourist attraction on Echo Mountain and Mount Lowe, north of Los Angeles, California. The railway, originally incorporated by Professor Thaddeus S. C. Lowe as the Pasadena & Mt. Wilson Railroad Co.[1] existed from 1893 until its official abandonment in 1938, and had the distinction of being the only scenic mountain, electric traction (overhead electric trolley) railroad ever built in the United States. Lowe’s partner and engineer was David J. Macpherson, a civil engineer graduate of Cornell University. The Mount Lowe Railway was a fulfillment of 19th century Pasadenans to have a scenic mountain railroad to the crest of the San Gabriel Mountains. The Railway opened on 4 July 1893, and consisted of nearly seven miles (11.2 km) of track starting in Altadena, California at a station called Mountain Junction. The railway climbed the steep Lake Avenue and crossed the Poppyfields into the Rubio Canyon. This part of the trip was called the Mountain Division.[2] At this juncture stood the Rubio Pavilion, a small 12-room hotel. From there the passengers transferred to a cable car funicular which climbed the Great Incline to the top of the Echo Mountain promontory.[3] Atop Echo stood the magnificent 70-room Victorian hotel, the Echo Mountain House. Only a few hundred feet away stood the 40-room Echo Chalet which was ready for opening day. The complement of buildings on Echo included an astronomical observatory, car barns, dormitories and repair facilities, a casino and dance hall, and a menagerie of local fauna.[4]Passengers could then transfer to another trolley line, the Alpine Division, which would take them to the upper terminus at Crystal Springs and Ye Alpine Tavern, a 22-room Swiss Chalet hospice with a complement of amenities from tennis courts, to wading pools, to mule rides.[5] For the seven years during which Lowe owned and operated the railway, it constantly ran into hard times. For one, its location was off the beaten path of the common traveler with little means of transportation up to the Altadena hillside.[6] For another, fares did not cover the cost of continuous construction done on money borrowed at 10 1/2% interest, and the opening day fare of $5.00 would not remain attractive to the greater public.[7] Lowe went into receivership one or two times before losing the railway to Jared S. Torrance in 1899.[8] The tiny railway was purchased at auction by a Mr. Valentine Payton of Danville, Illinois[9] who, after only 14 months, sold it to Henry Huntington of the Pacific Electric Railway in 1902.[10] Huntington operated it as a fringe venture the rest of its days alongside his expansive Red Car system that covered the greater Los Angeles and Orange County areas. A series of natural disasters ate away at the facilities, the first of which was a kitchen fire that destroyed the Echo Mountain House in 1900.[11] A 1905 fire destroyed the rest of the Echo buildings except for the observatory and the astronomer's cabin.[12] In 1909 a flash flood tore out the Rubio Pavilion.[13] In 1928 a gale force wind toppled the observatory.[14] And in 1936 an electrical fire wiped out the Tavern.[15] The Mount Lowe Railway was officially abandoned in 1938 after a horrendous rain washed most everything off the mountain sides.[16] Today, the ruins of Mount Lowe Railway remain as a monument to a once-ever experienced enterprise. It was placed on the National Register of Historical Places on January 6, 1993.

The slow-moving storm produced over 10 inches (25 cm) of rain in New England, causing widespread flooding of urban and low-lying areas. Winds of up to 70 miles per hour (110 km/h) snapped trees and power lines, resulting in over 1 million homes and businesses left without electricity. The storm also caused extensive coastal flooding and beach erosion. The nor'easter was the fifth major winter storm to impact the Mid-Atlantic and New England in the 2009-10 winter season. In Connecticut, winds of up to 70 miles per hour (110 km/h) toppled trees and snapped power lines, with the heaviest damage reported in Fairfield County. Falling trees damaged or destroyed several homes in Connecticut, and the destruction was the worst experienced in Fairfield County since Hurricane Gloria struck the state in 1985. At the height of the storm on March 14, more than 110,000 customers were without electricity. By March 16, Connecticut Light and Power (CL&P) reported that 40,000 customers remained in the dark. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2010_North_American_winter_storm","cat, cats, iphone, nor-easter, northeaster, plog, storm, strays and others"

8749563649,FRAPPANT-IKEA a box for a box,"Who needs an inner-city IKEA? “Frappant” Building in Hamburg-Altona situated in the Neue Grosse Bergstrasse, opened in 1973 as part of a highly praised and worldwide noticed concept of inner-city shopping and as a state of the art 70’s architecture. The world war two shaken and bombed street stood for a new and modern approach in which the gigantic building stood as a landmark. Already two years later and as an impact of the ‘73 oil crisis and its effects on business, the concept came to crisis, due to simple lack of profit. Different companies and enterprises tried to reprofit and revitalize the building, but failed through the years. Meanwhile the concept of concrete casted moderness also came to crisis and the last remaining retailer Karstadt left the building in 2003. The empty building, now under real estate speculation and not properly maintained, was then used by artists, musicians and alternative music-clubs, while the city was still unsuccessfully looking for new investors. Suspicious about the now alternative, non-profit but vital use of the building, the ECA, a local lobby group of business and politicians, started labeling the building as an eyesore and pressure was build up to tear it down. Politicians (including the Green Party) then offered the building to IKEA, that had already focused on another spot closer the motorway and never dreamed of such an offer. This decision then led to wide protest among the local population, fearing gentrification through higher rents and increasing pollution from Ikea traffic. Politicians and lobby groups now unsure of the developing resistance, staged a referendum in the district, under the suggestive question: Are you in favour of a new Ikea in Altona, that will sustainable vitalize and increase attractiveness of the Grosse Bergstrasse. An assertion that has yet to be proofed. Pro-Ikea, winning the referendum by 77%, gave way to IKEA to buy and build. With this decision, alternative concepts of a low and non-profit use were binned and to avoid squatting the whole building was soon demolished by the district. Meanwhile, Ikea not having even started to build their 7 stories inner-city big-box, shop and resident rents in the area are leveling up and the first old shops already had to close or go. The area now started to become an investment-ground for real estate and with the rising of the Ikea building site, whole plans to restructure other parts of the street are in full affect. The topic is as controversial and polarized as it was from the very start: Critics claim, that Ikea will not just bring traffic and pollution, but also and more important, a total change of the local structure, both in local business as in housing. It is feared that other chain companies like Starbucks , H&M and others will eventually destroy the local shops and social structure. It is also criticized that a box is replaced by a box, making the street even more narrow and shady. The resistance against IKEA not merely is a resistance against the company, but also a struggle for Altona-Altstadt, their diverse and not very wealthy population, their wellbeing and their very own right to the city.","altona, altona altstadt, baustelle, gentrification, gentrifizierung, germany, große bergstraße, hamburg, ica, ikea, kein ikea in altona, local business, protest, small business"

The church dates from the early part of the 12th century, and was modified during the following century. It closed as a church in 1678, and was then used for some 250 years for non-religious purposes. It is located by a farm, and was used as a farm building. The church was restored in the early 20th century, and again later in the century. St Benedict's is constructed in ragstone rubble, and has a tiled roof. Its plan is simple, consisting of two cells, a nave and a chancel. The windows and doors are round-headed. The interior is plain, and it contains a gallery added in the 19th century.

7349131634,Cobh - The Last Port Of Call For The Titanic,"Cobh - The Last Port Of Call For The Titanic In August 2005 I visited Cork with the intention of photographing the City as well as the town of Cobh but it rained from the minute I arrived in Cork and it was so heavy that I could not use my camera so I gave up and went home after two days. This week I decided to revisit Cork and Cobh and of course it rained from the minute that I arrived and it is still raining. Anyway I was better prepared this time and managed to take some photographs but some are a bit blurred (especially those taken on Fota Park) because of the constant rain. I also visited Midleton but upon my arrival in the town there was flash flooding. Cobh is a seaport town on the south coast of County Cork, Ireland. Cobh is on the south side of Great Island in Cork Harbour. Facing the town are Spike Island and Haulbowline Island. On a high point in the town stands Cobh (St Colman's) Cathedral, one of the tallest buildings in Ireland and seat of the diocese of Cloyne. One of the major transatlantic Irish ports, Cobh was the departure point for 2.5 million of the six million Irish people who emigrated to North America between 1848 and 1950. On 11 April 1912 Queenstown was the final port of call for the RMS Titanic as she set out across the Atlantic on her ill-fated maiden voyage. She was assisted by the PS America and PS Ireland, two aging White Star Line tenders, along with several other smaller boats delivering first-class luggage. Local lore has it that a Titanic crew member John Coffey, a native of Queenstown, jumped ship although there is no record of him on the crew list. 123 passengers boarded in all; only 44 survived the sinking. Cobh was also a major embarkation port for men, women and children who were deported to penal colonies such as Australia. The records of such deportations can be found in the ship log books in the Cobh Museum, which since 1973 is housed in Scots church (Presbyterian church until 1969 closure) overlooking the harbour. Due to its maritime advantages, a significant shipbuilding industry developed in Cobh and the remnants of the Verolme Shipyard today maintain many of the original cranes and hoists which now form part of the significant industrial and maritime heritage of Cobh which is considered to have major tourism potential. The age of steam brought famous achievements to Cobh, most notably the first steam ship to sail from Ireland to England (1821) and the first steam ship to cross the Atlantic (Sirius 1838) which left from Passage West. In 1849 the name of the town was changed to Queenstown to honour Queen Victoria who visited Ireland in that year. Several other notable ships are associated with the town, including: The Cunard passenger liner RMS Lusitania was sunk by a German U-Boat off the Old Head of Kinsale while en route to Liverpool on May 7, 1915. 1198 passengers died, while 700 were rescued. The survivors and victims were brought to the town of Cobh, and over one hundred lie buried in the Old Church Cemetery just north of the town. The Lusitania Peace memorial is located in Casement Square opposite the arched building housing the Cobh Library and Courthouse.","cobh, cork, corkbyinfomatique, county cork, europe, infomatique, ireland, republic of ireland, titanic"

3450149901,Schlüsselburg - Lnáře Municipality. Former Prachens province in the southwest of Bohemia.,"Schlüsselburg - Lnáře Municipality. Former Prachens province in the southwestern Bohemia/CZE. Schlüsselburg - Lnáře - Town of Lnar Municipality It lies in the northwestern part of Prachens province, some 50 km to the southeast from PILSEN or 100 km southwards from PRAGUE. The easiest way how to reach the locality is to follow international route E49 from Pilsen to [Bohemian] Budweis. Municipality was mentioned for the first time in the start of the 14th century AD, yet it has been inhabited continually since the 7.-6. century BC by Celts, Marcomans, Doudlebs and their posterity. First knights of Schlüsselburg were an aristocracy of German origin residing at so-called ‚Old Stronghold‘ near a passing of Smolivec Brook en route from the Pisek City to the Pilsen City. Why two names? That’s quite simple – the German name is probably older and means ‚The Key Fort‘, for a legendary golden key was found on the site of fort on the day of St. Mary. The Bohemian name is far less romantic – a flix plant [used as material by common people for their clothing ] was grown here in a large quantity, therefore Lnare means ‚Flix-growers’municipality‘. The English name ‚Town of Lnar‘ could be still find on a 1945 WWII memorial in the centre. The ancient Prachens Region had had its first centre in Prachens [Horazdovice, 20km to the south], than for centuries in Pisek City until the 19th century. Schlüsselburg was a village drowned in „sea of woods“ on the shores of muddy streams in a vast swampland, which actually covered much of nowadays Blatna Valley. This bogs had been (similarily to another famous lake district town of Wittingau-Trebon) transformed into a very extensive lakeland with hundreds of ponds and lakes. Not only these new semi-artificial lakes protected municipality from health issues connected to bogs and severe floods, but enabled growth of famed fishing industry, major source of revenues until quite recently. After 17th century some decline in fishing industry occurred and much of the waters were drained for new, prospective usage – sheep pastures. As of 1840 there were some 13,000 sheep. Second revival of the fishing industry occured during the 19th century, thanks to the care of local aristocracy. In the 19th century Dr. Theodor Mokry created a breed of an unscaly carp called ‚Lnarsky modrak‘ (‚Bluefish of Lnare‘). A wave of modernity arrived with first train on a brand line between towns Blatná and Pomuk-Dvorec some hundred years ago. Unfortunately for the municipality this train line eased a dramatical outflow of locals into fast growing metropolis of West Bohemian Region, Pilsen. After 1918 the municipality became part of Czechoslovakia, later of Protectorate ‘Böhmen und Mähren‘ and after 1948 part of Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The winter Velvet Revolution of 1989 brought an end to this totalitarian state and we are enjoying first 20 years of cultural, social and economic revival. Our two chateaux returned to local hands; the larger ‚New‘, to non-aristocratic Vanicek Family and the ‚Old‘ one belongs to the municipality. Devastating floods in August 2002 damaged strongly our valley but we succeeded in rebuilding all of it during 2002-2004. We are pleased to welcome more and more European newcomers [settlers] and visitou every year. Thank You for Your favour ;-) Municipality is rich in architecture, unique landscape and sights, for example: Baroque church of St. Joseph [17. century] with very unique fresco paintings Baroque Chateau [or ‚New Chateau‘, 17. century] - frescoes with mythical ancient Gods, English-French garden [4 hect.] with a little mosque, several stone fountains, pools and rare wood species… Chapel of St. Anna [end of the 17. cent.] Annaberg - complex of frame houses, first half of the 19. cent. (in the style of SW German Swabia) ‚Old Stronghold‘ - at least 700 years old remnant of original wooden fort , rebuilt in 1597 as a stone-brick Renaissance chateau; first mentioned in 1465. Now hosts a gallery of contemporary art, infocentre, and flats. Monumental classical barnyard from the 19. century Primary school, more than 110 years old Parish & monastery Church of the Saintest Trinity with the icon of Our Mother of Lnar [17. cent.] Gothical grave-yard Church of St. Nicholas [14. cent.] Baroque Chapel in Zahorcice [17. cent.] Baroque sculptures of saint protectors [at least 9 of them] Baroque sculptures of [11 pieces, 17. century] The Giant Logan [some 30 tons, 5 km to the south in Kadov; protected by the law. The biggest and perhaps the most easily accessible in all Bohemia] Perfect organised pathways/cycleways with infopanels through the countryside For Geochaching lovers – few caches are to be found here as well ;-) plus a great wealth of protected lakes, meadows, woods, castles, churches....

6209583765,Colorado - Idaho Springs: Argo Gold Mine and Mill - Offices,"These were the offices of Samuel Newhouse, James Hanchett and Charles Taylor. The Argo Gold Mine and Mill, at 2350 Riverside Dr, is a former mine and gold that opened on April 1, 1913 at the entrance of the 4.6-mile Newhouse Tunnel, later called the Argo Tunnel. The Tunnel was built between 1893 and 1910 to drain the gold mines in Virginia Canyon, Gilpin Gulch, Russell Gulch, Quartz Hill, Nevadaville, and Central City. The mill, one of the largest and most modern in Colorado, was built by R.E. Shimer to strip the valuable metals like gold, silver, copper and lead from the ore extracted from the tunnel. Following a flooding accident in 1943 that left four miners dead, the tunnel was closed, and Argo Mill ceased operations. The five-story mill sat abandoned until 1976 when it was purchased by James N. Maxwell, who renovated it and opened it to the public as a museum. The bottom level of the mill serves as a museum displaying mining and milling artifacts, old payroll records, milling receipts, and old photographs. After touring the Dougle Eagle mine, and the Argo Mill, visitors can pan for gold and gems.
