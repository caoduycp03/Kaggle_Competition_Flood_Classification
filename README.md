The goal of this task is to retrieve all images which show direct evidence of a flooding event from social media streams, independently of a particular event. The objective is to design a system/algorithm that given any collection of multimedia images and their metadata (e.g., YFCC100M, Twitter, Wikipedia, news articles) is able to identify those images that are related to a flooding event. Please note, that only those images which convey an evidence of a flooding event will be considered as True Positives. Specifically, we define images showing unexpected high water levels in industrial, residential, commercial and agricultural areasâ€œ as images providing evidence of a flooding event. The main challenges of this task are the proper discrimination of the water level in different areas (e.g., images showing a lake vs. showing high water at a street) as well as the consideration of different types of flooding events (e.g., coastal flooding, river flooding, pluvial flooding).
